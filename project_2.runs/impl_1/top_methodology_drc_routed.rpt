Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin d1/design_1_i/test_ram_2_0/inst/t_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin instance_name/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, d1/sys_clock, instance_name/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>
