TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clk_wiz_div/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_wiz_0, clkfbout_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clk_wiz_div/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_clk_wiz_0, clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1
